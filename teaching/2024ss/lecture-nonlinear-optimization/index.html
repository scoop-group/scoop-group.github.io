	Description
	<a href="#description" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2><p>This class provides a detailed overview of algorithms for unconstrained and constrained smooth, nonlinear optimization problems in finite dimensions.
It will emphasize the interplay of optimization and numerical linear algebra.
Optimality conditions and associated constraint qualifications for constrained problems will be presented and discussed.
Moreover, the class will give an introduction to algorithmic differentiation (AD).</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">
	Prerequisites
	<a href="#prerequisites" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2><p>Skills from Analysis I and II (MA1/ MA2), Lineare Algebra I (MA4) as well as basic optimization skills are highly recommended.</p>
<h2 id="concept-and-components">
	Concept and Components
	<a href="#concept-and-components" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2><p>This class is comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed lecture notes</li>
<li>2x 2h lectures per week</li>
<li>Exercise sheets with corresponding answer sheets</li>
<li>Tutorials for co-working on exercise sheets</li>
<li>An exam following the end of the lecture period</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dates-and-schedule">
	Dates and Schedule
	<a href="#dates-and-schedule" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2><p>Information on the exercise labs can be found in <a href="https://muesli.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/lecture/view/1850">MÜSLI</a>.</p>
<p>Please also refer to the <a href="./schedule.pdf"title="class&amp;rsquo; schedule">class&rsquo; schedule</a>.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">
	Exercises
	<a href="#exercises" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2><p>Exercises will be centered around one exercise sheet per week containing both theoretical/analytical questions and numerical/implementation exercises.
Default programming language &ndash; in the sense that it will be used in our answer sheets and we will be providing support for it &ndash; will be Python.
Feel free to work with another programming laguage that is suitable for implementing the optimization algorithms if you are self sufficient working with it.</p>
<p>In the exercise tutorials (see <a href="https://muesli.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/lecture/view/1850">MÜSLI</a>), you will have the oportunity to work on the exercise sheets with your peers and with support from our tutors.
You can get the most out of their time if you show up having already taken a first look at the exercises and bringing your own questions and discussion topics to the meetings.
Feel free to ask questions on the lecture notes or the lectures as well.</p>
<p>For successful participation in this semester&rsquo;s exercises, you will be asked to submit your exercises weekly, see <a href="#exams"title="exams">exams</a>.
To evaluate your success on the exercise sheets, please compare your work with the answer sheets we will provide and, of course, feel free to talk to your tutor in the labs.</p>
<p>You may work on the exercises in groups of up to five students.</p>
<p>Please submit your work via <a href="https://moodle.uni-heidelberg.de/course/view.php?id=21857">Moodle</a> in the following format:</p>
<p>The name of every group member must be represented in the file name. The members are separated by an underscore &ldquo;_&rdquo;. Each member is specified in the format &ldquo;firstname(s)-surname(s)&rdquo;. Should you have multiple surnames or first names, simply join them without any separator. The listing of the members is followed by an underscore and a tag for the current sheet in the format exsheetnumber. The sheet number must have two digits. If the exercise only requires a PDF, then a simple file upload suffices. Should the exercise require multiple files, such as some code files, etc., bundle them into a zip archive. The name of the archive must follow the conventions specified above. Example:</p>
<p>firstname(s)1-lastname(s)1_firstname(s)2-lastname(s)2_ex01.zip</p>
<p>Mario Maric and Viktor Stein von Kamienski are group members and want to hand in a PDF and a Jupyter notebook for sheet number 4. They archive both files into a zip and call it:</p>
<p>Mario-Maric_Viktor-Steinvonkamienski_ex04.zip</p>
<p>We will use this naming scheme to identify and track the groups. The order of the members, the capitalization of the names, or how many people uploaded the file is irrelevant. Just make sure that the spelling of the members does not change between different assignments. A failure to adhere to this convention will result in a fail on the assignment.</p>

</h2><p>To register for this class, please register for an exercise group at <a href="https://muesli.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/lecture/view/1850">MÜSLI</a>.
Please also register in case you are interested in participating in this class but not in the exercises.
This will allow us to get an idea of class demand.</p>
<p>Attention(!): Registration for the class does not automatically include registration for an examination.
More information on the exams can be found in the section <a href="#exams"title="exams">exams</a>.</p>

	Exams
	<a href="#exams" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2><p>We will be offering exams at the end of the semester and during the following summer break.</p>
<p>You may attend up to two exams. It is also possible to not register for the first exam and only attend the second exam.
If you pass the exam, you can not take another exam for this course.
In case you pass neither of the two offered exams, you have to wait until this course is offered again for the next attempt. It is up to the respective lecturer, whether your admission to the exam will remain valid in following semesters.</p>
<p>It is important that you register in <strong>HeiCo</strong>, so that we can officially submit your exam results.</p>
